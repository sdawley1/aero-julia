These notebooks are based on a course taught at the George Washington University. The original code and notes can be found here:

The notebooks linked above are written in Python. I rewrote them in Julia because I thought the plots could be improved upon. The lessons are layed out as follows:

1. [Sources & Sinks](https://nbviewer.org/github/sdawley1/aero-julia/blob/master/01_Sources_and_Sinks.ipynb) - What is the theoretical basis for aerodynamics?
2. [Source & Sink in a Freestream](https://nbviewer.org/github/sdawley1/aero-julia/blob/master/02_Sources_Sinks_Freestreams.ipynb) - A body within a freestream leads to points of stagnation!
3. [Doublets](https://nbviewer.org/github/sdawley1/aero-julia/blob/master/03_Doublets.ipynb) - A *doublet* is like a source-sink pair at an infinitesimally short distance apart from each other.
4. [Vortices](https://nbviewer.org/github/sdawley1/aero-julia/blob/master/04_Vortex.ipynb) - A *vortex* is a region of fluid which revolves around some axis.
5. [An Infinite Row of Vortices](https://nbviewer.org/github/sdawley1/aero-julia/blob/master/05_Infinite_Row_of_Vortices.ipynb) - Deriving a closed-form expression for the vector field about an infinite row of vortices is hard...
6. [Lift from a Vortex](https://nbviewer.org/github/sdawley1/aero-julia/blob/master/06_Vortex_Lift.ipynb) - 
7. TBA
